This usually requires learning more about mathematics (linear algebra and numerical analysis), statistics (including some basic probability theory), and computer science. You do *not* need to master any or all of these, but it is best to develop a deep understanding in at least one of those areas while being effectively *literate/knowledgeable/fluent* in the language of the others.

        "1. Many machine learning algorithms benefit from [***feature scaling***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_scaling) (sometimes called *data normalization*). Gradient descent in particular benefits from feature scaling. What is feature scaling? It is a *pre-processing* of data. Perhaps the most common feature scaling method is ***standardization***. The basic idea is that by re-scaling the ranges of the individual features into comparable length scales, we can better assess how to weight the individual features based on their importance in explaining the variation in data. \n",
        "\n",
        "> Imagine we collect data on heights and weights of adults, and then try to predict some health outcome based on this data (e.g., whether or not they have arthritis, heart disease, or other conditions that we believe may be linked to an individual's size). If the height is in feet, then the range might be $[4, 7]$, and if the weight is in pounds, then the range might be $[70, 500]$. These disparate magnitudes and ranges of values will often negatively impact our machine learning algorithm. Standardization (also called Z-score normalization) will transform each feature so that its sample mean is zero and sample standard deviation is one. This will generally improve the performance of the machine learning algorithm. \n",
        "\n",
        "You can Google \"importance of standardization of data\" to get more information on the topic. We simply mention it is important here.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Variants of gradient descent may be required for large data sets. While we are dealing with relatively small data sets for the purposes of learning how to do things, you should be aware of some important variants of algorithms that rely on gradient descent that are useful for \"big data.\" These include [stochastic gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent) and mini-batch gradient descent.

        "Perhaps $x_1$ denotes height, $x_2$ denotes the weight, $x_3$ denotes the 40-yard dash time, $x_4$ denotes the number of times the player bench presses 225lbs, $x_5$ denotes how high the player can jump, and so on (maybe the last attribute $x_m$ denotes their score on the Wonderlic test, which seems to be important more for quarterbacks and offensive lineman although even that is debatable). \n",

Well, I pulled *years* (5-10 years) of combine data from pro-football-reference.com at various skill positions (QB, RB, WR), and I could *not* see any approximate separability (even with a kernel trick) in the data. I *think* there are too many confounding factors in the data that impact player success beyond individual physical/mental features such as the quality of the team that drafts the player, how the player's talents fit into the style of the team, and of course injuries (and suspensions) that derail many careers. \n",

Data science follows the same rules as all of computational science and statistics in that no single method should be universally applied to every problem. This is just a silly thing to assume.
