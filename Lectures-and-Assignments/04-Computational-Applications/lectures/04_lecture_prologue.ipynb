        "- Whenever you are solving problems in computational and data science that require you to repeatedly investigate, explore, or perform computations upon the same *object*, then you should probably start thinking in terms of classes. This is especially true when you start referring to a \"thing\" as an \"object\" since that is a giveaway that you are dealing with a particular instance of a class. There are of course exceptions. You need to use judgment to determine the best balance of complexity required in a code to accomplish the desired tasks with the overall readability, portability, and usability of the code.\n",
        "\n",

You would of course be correct that we *could* do this for *any* polynomial. Unfortunately, there are an uncountably infinite number of polynomials we may consider, and we may find ourselves having to code up many user-defined polynomials in a single code, which not only becomes repetitive, but is also more likely to introduce errors. \n",
        "\n",
        "- Also, we are often interested in many properties/features of a polynomial related to its manipulation through derivatives or integrals which are themselves polynomials (calculus concepts), the sign of the polynomial at a particular point (direct evaluation), and qualitative features related to its graph (plotting). These all represent various data/method attributes we may wish to *attach* to a particular polynomial object.\n",
