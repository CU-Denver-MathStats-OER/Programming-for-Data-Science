    "\n",
    "To discuss [web scraping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping), we first provide an analogy and then some useful terminology.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style='background:rgba(255,0,255, 0.25); color:black'> ***An analogy:*** <span>\n",
    "\n",
    "- You have probably acted as a *human web scraper* at some point by using copy/paste. \n",
    "\n",
    "  For instance, suppose you wanted to complain about the Broncos roster construction to a friend. You may go to their [roster web page](http://www.denverbroncos.com/team/roster.html) and copy the roster data from it before pasting it in an email. \n",
    "\n",
    "  The basic idea of a web scraper is to automate this otherwise mundane human process.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  For instance, while a single copy/paste of roster data into a single email may not seem that annoying. Imagine that you wanted to put the contents of various rosters into multiple emails because you are managing an email list for a sports website. You are going to get really annoyed very quickly with having to constantly check for updates on the rosters across all NFL teams.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  However, there are some issues with this. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  As a human, you can use your judgment as to what data are relevant on a given web page no matter the format. In other words, even if we are unsure of how the data will appear that we are looking for, we *know it when we see it*. This is a uniquely human trait that an automated web scraper does not possess. \n",
    "\n",
    "<span style='background:rgba(255,0,255, 0.25); color:black'> ***Terminology:*** <span>\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Fetching* refers to the downloading of a web page. In the analogy, this is like copying the entire web page. This is what your browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.) does when you view the page, which is why you can still view the contents of a web page even if your lose your connection to the internet. \n",
    "\n",
    "- *Scraping* refers to the extraction of data from the downloaded contents of a web page. In the analogy, this is determining what part of the copied web page data to paste. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style='background:rgba(255,0,255, 0.25); color:black'> ***The computers are only as smart as we are:*** <span>\n",
    "\n",
    "- When we look at a web page, we only see what I would call *relevant* information on a web page. \n",
    "\n",
    "  A web scraper will load in all the data of a web page as raw html code through a fetch command, which will include *metadata* describing how things are supposed to look on the web page as well as any other \"behind the scenes\" information. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  This generally means that in order to construct a useful web scraper, we (meaning us as human beings) have to understand something about the html structure of websites and how the data we wish to analyze from these websites is presented. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  This allows us to *scrape* only the data we want from this mess of html data. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  Consequently, web scrapers are usually built to explore web pages belonging to a single website. \n",
    "\n",
    "- For instance, we may create a web scraper to optimally collect statistics on various NBA players available from the website https://www.espn.com/nba/ where each individual athlete has a separate \"profile\" web page within this website (e.g., see [Jimmy Butler](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6430/jimmy-butler)). The way in which the data is structured and potentially scaffolded across multiple sub-pages can vary significantly from how other websites may present the data (e.g., see [Jimmy Butler](https://www.nba.com/players/jimmy/butler/202710) on https://www.nba.com/). \n",
    "\n",
    "<span style='background:rgba(255,0,255, 0.25); color:black'> ***Ethics:*** <span>\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping also comes with some important legal and ethical concerns. If you think of a web scraper as a *bot*, then once this *bot* is tuned to a website and turned loose, it can clearly gather data much faster than even an army of human users possibly could. Subsequently, if you use the *bot* too aggressively (i.e., you *spam* the website with lots of requests for data), you may break the website. Moreover, the legality of web scraping is also murky. You should check the *Terms and Conditions* of a website before you scrape it. Find and read the statements about the legal use of data, which usually allow you to scrape data as long as it is not for commercial purposes. Some websites have a robots.txt file that may explicitly say whether or not they allow web scrapers.\n",

    "Suppose your institution already possesses the data you need to analyze in a file with a *typical format* that is understood by common data analysis programs (such as Excel or SQL). In this case, you do not need to go searching through web sites, but you do need to know how to *read* the data from the file in order to analyze it. Your analysis may need to be added to this existing file or put in a new file to be used by others. In these cases,  you need to know how to *write* data to a file in the correct format. You may even find yourself reading in data from a file, adding in new data from web scraping, and then saving that data along with any analysis of that data to an altogether new file. \n",

    "    - There are some useful resources on getting started with Beautiful Soup, e.g., see [towards data science's introduction on web scraping](https://towardsdatascience.com/an-introduction-to-web-scraping-with-python-a2601e8619e5), [data camp's web scraping tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/web-scraping-using-python), or [medium's discussion on scraping data from a website](https://medium.com/backticks-tildes/how-to-scrape-data-from-a-website-ceda61204f67). \n",

    "- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/overview.html) is a very impressive module that you may become intimately familiar with if you ever do any serious data analysis.

[Pandas] aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis / manipulation tool available in any language. It is already well on its way toward this goal.\n",
    "\n",

    "   \n",
