What is a *derivative*? It is a concept from calculus, but here you can just think of it in very physical terms: the derivative of position as a function of time is velocity, the derivative of velocity as a function of time is acceleration, etc. (is there a physically meaningful derivative of acceleration?

Let $f(t)$ denote the first derivative of $h(t)$. Then, the solutions to $f(t)=0$ (i.e., the roots of $f(t)$) give the potential times of maximum/minimum heights. We can then evaluate $h$ at all the roots of $f$ to determine what the heights are at these *critical* values. \n",
