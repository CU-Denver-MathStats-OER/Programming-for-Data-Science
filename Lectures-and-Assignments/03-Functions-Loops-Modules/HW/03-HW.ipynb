    "> We have some information about \"what happens\" at a point in space, denoted by $\\mathbf{c}$, and we want to use this information to \"infer what may happen\" at a point $\\mathbf{x}$. \n",

    "In the context of the big picture idea, we expect RBFs to exhibit the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If $\\mathbf{x}$ is \"close\" to $\\mathbf{c}$, then the knowledge we have about what happens at $\\mathbf{c}$ should play a big role in informing what we think may happen at $\\mathbf{x}$. \n",

    "- If $\\mathbf{x}$ is \"far away\" from $\\mathbf{c}$, then perhaps we should reduce how much we rely on the knowledge we have at $\\mathbf{c}$ to inform us about what may happen at $\\mathbf{x}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How do we go from concept to practice? \n",
    "\n",
    "A few things have to be made more concrete: what functions exhibit such desirable features, what do we mean by \"close\" and \"far away\", and how do we measure distance anyway?\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this a bit more mathematically precise, we formalize our notation. \n",
    "- Let $\\phi$ denote an RBF that maps a \"distance\" $r\\in[0,\\infty)$ into $\\mathbf{R}$ such that $\\phi(0)$ is the maximum and $\\phi(r_1)>\\phi(r_2)$ whenever $0\\leq r_1<r_2$.\n",

If you have never seen a norm before, do not worry, we will get some practice below. Primarily, in the context of this class, you can think of a norm as determining the length of a vector, which is simply stating how far the point defined by its coordinates are from the origin.\n",

This is sometimes called the 1-norm distance.\n",
