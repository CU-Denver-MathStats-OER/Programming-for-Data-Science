    "- Technically the $\\{b_k\\}_{k=1}^n$ set is indexed from $1$ to $n$ and there is no $b_0$ because $\\sin(0)=0$. However, in code we find it convenient to define $b_0:=0$ and consider the set as $\\{b_k\\}_{k=0}^n$ so that both sets of coefficients are of the same shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $n$ is generally a positive integer and larger $n$ values are generally associated with better approximations of $f(x)$. However, we can also let $n=0$ in which case we have no summation and are approximating $f(x)$ by its average value $\\frac{a_0}{2}$ over the domain $[-1,1]$.\n",
