        "  - It is a terrible idea to expect that you can sit down and work through all the material for the week in a single day. This will undoubtedly lead to failure at some point in the semester. Knowing this, how do you plan to manage your time so that you spend this minimum number of hours per week on this class spread out across multiple days in the week? Specifically, do you use a calendar/planner to make sure you are devoting at least this minimum amount of time towards achieving your goal spread out across two or more days in a week?\n",
