    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This question does not have an altogether obvious answer. After all, this is a 1000-level course, which means it is an introductory course. However, it is also a course that involves learning a programming language. Learning a programming language is a lot like learning a foreign language except that the rules of diction and syntax are **incredibly strict**. It is therefore quite common to view introductory programming courses as *objectively difficult* by 1000-level course standards. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is also not just any programming course. This is a programming *for* **data science**. You may have a fuzzy notion of what data science actually is. Wikipedia has a reasonable description of [data science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science) as an interdisciplinary field that\n",
    "\n",
    "> uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, domain knowledge and information science.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, it is fair to view this as a programming class that exists at the intersection of mathematics, statistics, and computer science. Along the way, we will learn how to solve some common computational mathematics and statistics problems (in modules 04 and 06), scrape data from the web to analyze and interpret results in the context of *data storytelling* (in modules 05 and 06), and dip our toes ever so slightly into the realm of machine learning algorithms based on classifiers and artificial neurons (in module 06). \n",
    "\n",
    "**In other words, this is not your typical 1000-level course.**\n",
    "\n",
    "None of this is to say that this material is inaccesible at the 1000-level. It just means that we cover a lot of ground over the course of the semester. It also means you need to calibrate your expectations with respect to workload (expect 9-12 hours a week in a typical 16 week format, which is doubled during an 8 week format), how you schedule time for the course material (best to devote 2-3 hour time blocks, with no distractions, spread out over multiple days), and understand the following tenet of computational and data science:\n",
    "\n",
    "> You must become comfortable operating with an incomplete understanding of the problem. This is accomplished by identifying the portions of a problem that are necessary to understand in order to solve it correctly from the portions of a problem that simply allow you to solve it more elegantly. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are *not necessarily* after elegant solutions in this course. This is not to say that you should not pursue as elegant a solution as you can. It is simply to say that we are focused on developing the following things:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Basic Jupyter and Python programming skills (modules 01-03)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Basic problem-solving skills that require modifying/applying existing code (modules 04-06)\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way, you will likely find that you are pushed out of your comfort zone on a number of occasions. But, remember the tenet and you will start to develop comfort and confidence in being uncomfortable. It certainly helps to realize that ***no one knows everything and you are not expected to be perfect at anything.*** \n",
    "\n",
    "To help guide you along the way, this course will use interactive content such as this Jupyter notebook to parse out ideas as carefully as we can. Additionally, you will often have large portions of code presented to you in their entirety. It is incredibly common in the field of data science to start your work where someone else's work ended. To this end, you will often be asked to add useful *code comments*, *textual interpretations/analysis of results*, and even *tests* for the code. These are incredibly valuable skills and practices to cultivate early on in your budding career. They force you to not simply accept a piece of code as written on the face value of it running free of errors. You should always examine, interpret, and think about the typical use cases for code. \n",
